## Project Memory

This is a modern full-stack monorepo project where each application features a FastAPI backend with a Vanilla Javascript and CSS frontend and modern development tooling.  

## Tech Stack

**Environment Variables**

All environment variables will be found under ./<app>/.env

**Backend:**
- Python with `uv` for package management
- FastAPI for API framework
- OpenAPI automatic client generation
- Each application uses Python and FastAPI for its backend
- Each application will specify their own persistence mechanism:
  - Application 1 may use Oracle
  - Application 2 may use MongoDB  
  - Application 3 may use Databricks
- All apps connect to their databases through Python libraries/drivers

**Frontend:**
- HTML5
- Use Bootstrap as the frontend toolkit
- Use the following primary colors in the user interface
 - #FF3621
 - #0B2026
 - #EEEDE9
 - #F9F7F4
- DM Sans is the primary font choice
- Do not cram text elements too close together
- Use vanilla javascript. Avoid JavaScript frameworks
- Bun for package management
- Make sure that each application under this project have some user interface differences so that they look like separate applications. Include the version of the application in the title name. 

## Development Workflow

### Package Management
- Use `uv add/remove` for Python dependencies, not manual edits to pyproject.toml
- Use `bun add/remove` for frontend dependencies, not manual package.json edits
- Always check if dependencies exist in the project before adding new ones

**Development Tasks:**
- "add a new API endpoint" → Creates FastAPI routes with proper patterns
- "debug this error" → Analyzes logs and fixes issues
- "install [package]" → Adds dependencies using uv (Python) or bun (frontend)
- "generate the API client" → Regenerates API client from OpenAPI spec
- "open the UI in playwright" → Opens the frontend app in Playwright browser for testing
